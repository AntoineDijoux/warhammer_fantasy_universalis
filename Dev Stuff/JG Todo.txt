		Change Human Admin bonus - make it nothing?
		Simplify Skaven modifiers- Lower Discipline, Lower Morale?

	Elf trade network stuff: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1314080313055510529/1315004963214200913

	Elf culture stuff: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1314080313055510529/1315008991826546873

	Remove restriction that you can't declare war while in the Karak 8 peak war.
		Simplify this whole thing

	Nagarythyn ideas: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1315328160153337937/1315334789133500447

	The araby are evil but the norsca and hobgoblins are neutral? i really only know lore stuff from the little there is in twwh but it feels weird
		Just change this to be based on religion. Araby should be nuetral

	I would suggest changing the nature of the grail quest, because every time i try it i just get another heir before they come back, meaning louen is effectively the only grail knight you're ever going to get, maybe change it into a series of events? 

	The MTTH for age decadence events should be looked at. Currently for any country with a ruler over 350 (So basically all elves, undead, the cathayan dragons, and probably more) age decadence events trigger, on average, every 53 months. Given how strong the negative effects of these events are, and how comparatively rare the counterpart age revival events are, (On average once every 140 months) it should trigger much less frequently.

	Rethink Raiding, chat with Theia
			WHAT IF RACIAL RAIDING IS AN END OF WAR PEACE OFFERING? THAT TAKES 75 WARSCORE? But that would mean you actually need to win the war, which kind of defeats the purpose

	Replace Comet event with Twin Tailed Comet Event

	it doesn't seem like Winter Teeth Tunnel is working as intended, since I couldn't walk through it during my war with Karak Hirn.

	Missions
		Make all missions a little harder
		Balance Mission Rewards
		Make Generic Beacon of power harder
		For highlighted provinces in missions, only highlight the ones you need, not also the ones you have
		Make racial rewards a little less?

	Give the racial admin tooltips that also explain the terrain thing

	Make release dominion action (that AI never do)

	On the latest patch 8/12/2024, strong stacks of beastmen assault the province repeatedly, roughly once every 2 to 3 years triggering via event.
		To wrap a minor suggestion into this, maybe beeckerhaven could have a province modifier that lets you remove the warherd via decision

	Also on this note, actually forming Estalia and accepting the new ideas thing swaps you to generic ones?
		Same thing happens when forming albion, although I'm not sure if that's intentional or not in that case tho?

	Skavenblight trade node is funky. Nevermind, its actually where skavenblight is in lore. Although i'd argue still to move it to ease confusion and also for practically nations in skavenblight itself can't get trade from it.

	Audacity Brettonian mission not working

	Not sure if this is a bug but why do some nations only have one tradition? Example Stirland, Averland, and Talabecland

	Enjoying orcs so far. There's a tribal confederation cb that does nothing and has no localization. Is that a placeholder?

	The Nehekharan Pantheon should have a decision you can take every so often which allows you to switch which diety you follow, since your rulers are immortal you're locked in unless you choose to get them killed

	War for karak8peaks - Clan Angrun U37 war names don't work - "No War Name"

	Playtest Bretts

	I see quite a few formables don't have custom ideas (Bretonnia doesn't have any at all it seems), maybe disable the ideas changing event in in these cases?

	Bretonnia has only one monument as well, I would have at least expected a vinyard or the like, or a port that buffs up their navy to reflect the lore of them having a really damn strong navy

	Add some token trade modifier to all artifacts so that they can be seen on the trade map

	Khorne Sacrifice events and decisions working?

	Brett's Find Ducal allies is impossible once you have vassalized verybody - prolly change it to vassalize or ally

	for example chaos wariors have an idea for better raising but they cant raise and if they form a horde they lose their unique reform

	Each of the elven Pantheon also gives a one time boost - manpower, money, or mana

#############################
######## MAP STUFF #######
#############################

	Prov 593, 762, 789, 134, 789 in wrong physical place. Tussenhof, Gellone, allenhof, Nuln

	Attempting to walk through Jaraiz from the irrana mountains state group to go to belemoz will make you path irregularly.

	Most of the Irrana Mountains need slight position nudging too, which you can do ingame by activating nudge mode, by putting -nudge in the startup console in steam -> eu4 -> properties.

	Units disappear when in certain tiles: Roughly the title, particularly tiles within the dwarven halls have this issue but I didn't see it playing as Karak Eight Peaks dwarves. Do appear when sieging for some reason. Also happens in 'The Vaults' with Gorr  + Rikkit (Tunnels to Skavenblight) and Thrash (Clan Scurvy Tunnels), i closed my thread i hadn't seen yours. Kurn + Thragg for the Irrana Tunnels state too. 

	odd visual bug when playing Brettonia, when armies are fighting they disappear from the map, would make it impossible to retreat an army from a losing battle. the orcs right next to marienburg and courounne seemingly

	Northern Verge is connected to Shatterskulls, and it shouldn't be

	Dissapearing battles bug also happens in the Laurelorn group of provinces. 

#############################
######## GFX STUFF #######
#############################

	Lizardfolk Holy Site gfx

	Crop the great project images.

	GFX for underground goods
		No image for fungi trade goods.

	GFX for gret seer council actions and holy see tab

#############################
######## FUTURE STUFF #######
#############################

	Many more cultures! Double the number of cultures in each culture group.

	Also there should be various monuments in the various peaks of Vala Azril Ungol

	In averlorn i´d change the Gaen Vale to farmland (or hills if you dont want to stack too much dev reduction on the province) and put the magical forest in the slopes of the Anuilli mountains

	Do we need immortal? Or just increase lifespan

	If a Chaos tribe takes the chaos gate, they become they become everchosen?

	Add Faceting and other events that change the price of goods

	Add in Beastmen as a playable faction.

	Necromancer and Vampire nations should be able to create set armies by decision/spell (if spell system is ever added) from nothing

	Decision for Greenskin and Skaven administrations to raid own lands!

	based on stuff like the weird amount of ogres ostland has and maneaters picking up things from their parent cultures

	What about attempt to cure chaos influence for civilizations of world by building waystones?

	Decolonize Dragon isles? You could always give those dragon isle lizardmen the stateless society reform as a tribal government. Allow for them to reform into a normal nation again if they get some alternative means of directing society

	kislev cav is so dirt cheap lmao, I has it as same cost of infantry within the first 20 years

	Add Nations
		Boris Ursus' faction from the Chaos Wastes

		Currently unused: Coilfang (Khureshi Snakefolk), Bubonic Swarm (Chaos Warband), Songhai (Araby), G.R.C. (???)
		The lost vikings on Albion also have norse ideas.

	Every Age should have a big bad?
		Orcs, Lizardfolk (old Ones), Nagash,

	Decision to get Nagash as a ruler

	Wood elf decision - if you control/subject all the magical forest (or a key province in each), then "Connect the World tree" to gain one of each development in all magical forests

	Go on a quest decision - take your ruler to a randomly set province on a different continent, maybe fight a rebel army there.

	New Lahmia & Vampire Coast , Barrow legions Ordo Draconics have placeholder Imperial ideas?

	Add Non-accepted culture governing cost increase back in - local_governing_cost = 1.0 ?

	Event for a high elf country to go dark elf culture/religion

	for Sylvania is there any way like event or anything to get that bald pretender Manfred off the throne and get Vlad and his lady back on?

	Add Panama Canal
	Disaster and event series for high elves to unify and fight off invaders if they land in ulthuan. number of provinces owned by a nation not of the right religion or culture.
		Or just an event that encourages high elves to do it - if you declar war, you get prestige and more trust and love with everybody else on the island.

	End Times Drama
		Being next to the everchosen (or any chaos dude) makes rebels spawn in that province?

	Recently Raided is weird. Maybe you can't undo the decision while at war, buut your warscore is 2x the cost?
	But then you can't selectively raid?
	Should it go away at the end of the war? Clear all recently raided?

	Raiding happens when people reclaim their own lands
	Might be fixed, check if this works. - Nope!

	Worry about military balance

	Make various diplomatic actions cause a pop-up for the receiver. And offers?
	Offer to become dominion action?
	Pop up when you can vassalize dominions (Doesn't work)
	Convert Them

	Is it possible to be both a race and undead? Undead human, undead orc? And gain both the racial and undead adm/military qualities

	Some relationship between racial administration and culture of individual province?

	At start of end times all good nations like each other more

	Fightiness events that give manpower don't give manpower if you're already above max? They give mil power or something else?

	Have a Vampiric mission create a center of reformation

	Ruinous power getting great vortex should trigger an event that makes a center of reformation on the location.

	Add some islands? Increase colonial range?

	Everchosen Cannot convert?

	Finish Starting localization

	Should Celestial REgency use EOC?
				

#############################
######### NAH STUFF #########
#############################

Legitimate Successor government mechanic for Nehekhara & Cathay?
	Event at high legitimate successor to declare independence war? Maybe it's a defensive war to give them a chance?
	Event for the overlord to reign them in (declar war), or suffer penalty to own legitimacy
	Pretty slow moving
	Government scale for legitimate successor, with increasing diplomatic reputation and liberty desire. Higher, more liberty desire for self, less liberty desire for others.

	Generic Beacon on a Hill mission with tech difference not working

	Give the hobgoblins fightiness?

	Change generic mission tree that gives claim rewards to be just provinces in culture group

	Should it be possible to change or have multiple racial administrations & militaries?
	To keep this balanced, either the racial admins/mils would need to be balanced with positives and negatives, or you get some broad negatives to counteract this. (like +unrest and unhappy estates for administration and -discipline for military)
	Maybe use the native religion reform mechanics for them? Aligns with slowly rebuilding/reforming the old empire
	Undead in particular is weird

A basic spell or two? Is mana = spell resource?
	Undead Spend 100 mil mana to gain a 10,000 manpower?


#############################
###### Flavor Pack Ideas ######
#############################

Kislev
	Give religion a push pull between Ursun and the Ice Witches?
	Disaster for resurgance of the old ways
		Unrest and can't declare wars until it's sorted?
	Fix Icons for the ursun religion?
	Kislev: i would have put the northern territories at independent or 90%s autonomies. Especially Troll Country.
	For kislev, I would suggest an option to return to worshiping the ancient widow, possibly with some content related to the hags?
		in the original lore Thor, Dazh, and Ursun were the children of the ancient widow
		but in NuKislev the only god that gets any focus is Ursun
		to the point where their centerpiece unit is the big elemental bear


Skaven
	Betray special diplomatic action?
	Ultimate is all warp stone at a certain development for weapon of mass destruction decision to nuke enemies
	Give them access to all the diplomatic actions early
	How to make these two actions not require a diplomat?
	Form the underempire as skaven starts the vermintide, similar to everchosen mechanic

Norscans
	Change Ultimate - lame as is. Number of ships captured?

Chaos Tribes
	Government Type should allow estates? Make sure everybody up there is the right gov type and tech group
	Mix up the religions of the different provinces upt north

Empire
	I'm curious what the rationale is for representing Altdorf, Nuln, and Talabheim as Republics is. I know that they're "Free Cities" in Imperial parlence, but all three seem to also be hereditary monarchies. Altdorf is a principality, Talabheim a Grand Duchy, and Nuln a county.
		this is particularly strange in the case of Nuln
		as it makes there be two different Emmanuelle von Liebwitz characters
		one the feudal ruler of Wissenland, the other an elected mayor of Nuln
		when really the two should be in a personal union
	league wars between the Sigmarites and the cult of Ulric.
	Witch hunter estate for empire?


Brettonia
		Bordeleaux should have either a port or a vinyard, and Moussilion is think would probbaly deserve a monument as well



Vampires

Wood Elves

Dark Elf
	Also, Naggarond shouldn't be single nation, no? Maybe it should be vassal swarm where vassal can declare war on other vassal, but must participate in their overlord wars? And until Malekith don't capture Phoenix Throne, he would be unable to integrate them. 
	Shrine of Khaine as a monument?



High Elves
	Sword of Khaine Disaster
		Decision to start using
		Can't stop using while at war
		Stability cost to stop using
		Disaster if using for too long


Lizards
	have a government mechanic which makes them stronger for each geomantic web city they control spread like 50 around the world.
		Province Group?
		Number of Superregions?
	Spell to make devestation in all enemy lands

Dwarves

Dwarfs
	Hashut missions are a little strange
		Maybe fewer accepted races, but better results from them


Ogre

Nehekhara
	Tension between the Nekeharan Pantheon and Nagashi
	Nagashi religion to ressurect Nagash

Orcs
	5 pulse events to move towards mork or gork
	Mork interaction: raise rebels in adjacent territories
	Gork interaction: more manpower and gold
	Make the fightiness AI choose nobody if every neighboring is at least 2x stronger than them. Should add a little fightiness.


Cathay

Araby
	Skism in Araby - If a ruler is 666, then a chance for them to declare themselves a prophet

Tomb Kings/Nehekhara
	Make Nagash worship more mechanically interesting.
	Change 7th Dynasty requirements to subject counld own?

############## Notes to remember ################
#################################################



Rename Estates by using war_estates_l_english and common > estates > burgers, church, nobles. Look for "estate_haggle_masters"

	Replace Prestige gain with: add_prestige_or_monarch_power = { amount = 10 }
	Replace Stability gain with: add_stability_or_adm_power = yes
