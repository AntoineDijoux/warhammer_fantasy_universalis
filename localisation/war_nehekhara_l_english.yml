### Events


tomb_king.3.title:0 "Caught in the Act"  
tomb_king.3.desc:0 "Two grave robbers have been apprehended while attempting to loot one of your sacred tombs. These audacious thieves dared to defile the resting place of one of Nehekhara’s honored dead, seeking to plunder its ancient treasures. Though their crime is unforgivable, the robbers plead for their lives, offering a share of the stolen riches to secure your mercy. \n\nYour priests and advisors are divided. Some argue that the looters should be executed to set an example and the treasures returned to the tomb, as per Nehekharan tradition. Others suggest keeping the treasures for the kingdom's benefit and ensuring their punishment remains swift. Or perhaps you could even encourage them to seek more loot, for wealth has its uses—even if it comes from dishonorable means."  
tomb_king.3.a:0 "Kill them, and return the loot."  
tomb_king.3.b:0 "Kill them and keep the loot."  
tomb_king.3.c:0 "Go get some more!"  

tomb_king.4.title:0 "An Undead Embarrassment"  
tomb_king.4.desc:0 "While addressing your troops before an upcoming campaign, a truly mortifying incident occurs: your jawbone unexpectedly detaches mid-speech and falls to the ground. The assembled skeleton warriors and priests, loyal as they are, appear visibly uncomfortable, with some suppressing awkward chuckles. Even in undeath, the pursuit of regal dignity proves to be an ongoing challenge.  \n\nThis small embarrassment may weaken your image if not addressed. You could ignore it, making light of the situation and embracing your undead nature for what it is. Alternatively, you could take steps to remedy this indignity, either through simple repair or by crafting a magnificent golden jaw to reinforce your aura of godhood."  
tomb_king.4.a:0 "So what? I'm dead, aren't I?"  
tomb_king.4.b:0 "Nothing some bandages can't fix."  
tomb_king.4.c:0 "A golden jaw shall adorn my face!"  

tomb_king.5.title:0 "The Crumbling Legions"  
tomb_king.5.desc:0 "Reports from your generals reveal a dire phenomenon gripping your armies. Entire companies of skeleton soldiers are collapsing into heaps of brittle bones without explanation, leaving gaps in your once-formidable formations. The generals theorize that the enchantments binding the souls of your warriors are beginning to decay, but the cause remains unclear.  \n\nYour advisors present three paths forward. You could choose to let the weak crumble, focusing on the stability of your remaining forces. Alternatively, a modest magical ritual might slow the decay at some cost, or you could command the necromancers to intensify their efforts and cast a grand incantation to fully restore your legions. Whatever you decide, time is of the essence."  
tomb_king.5.a:0 "Let them crumble, we have more."  
tomb_king.5.b:0 "A magical incantation will stem the decay."  
tomb_king.5.c:0 "Necromancers, supercharge that incantation!"  

tomb_king.6.title:0 "The Curse of Nagash"  
tomb_king.6.desc:0 "A foul corruption spreads across the lands of Nehekhara, its touch blighting all that it encounters. The oases dry up, turning to poisoned pools, and the skeletal legions grow restless, as if they sense a greater malevolence at work. The Liche Priests whisper that this is the work of Nagash’s lingering malice, a curse woven into the very sands that bind Nehekhara together.\n\nThis blight cannot be ignored, for it threatens the stability of your kingdom and the loyalty of your subjects. You may decide to defy Nagash’s curse, enduring the hardships and rallying your people against this unseen foe. Or, as your priests timidly suggest, you could seek to appease Nagash’s spirit, though doing so would risk your dignity and might embolden his cult."  
tomb_king.6.a:0 "We shall endure. Nehekhara bows to no one!"  
tomb_king.6.b:0 "Seek to appease Nagash's spirit."  

tomb_king.7.title:0 "Wrath of Usirian"  
tomb_king.7.desc:0 "The air grows heavy with divine fury as a great sandstorm descends upon your lands. Crops are buried beneath shifting dunes, settlements collapse under the weight of the storm, and your skeleton warriors struggle to stand amidst the howling winds. The priests declare that Usirian, god of the underworld, has grown displeased with your reign and has unleashed his wrath upon Nehekhara.\n\nThe choices before you are perilous. A grand sacrifice could be offered to appease Usirian, but the cost would be steep. Alternatively, you could weather the storm, allowing it to pass and rebuilding in its aftermath, though this would cause untold devastation. Perhaps, however, the storm could be redirected through sheer will, harnessed as a weapon to smite your enemies."  
tomb_king.7.a:0 "Do a sacrifice to please him."  
tomb_king.7.b:0 "Ride out the sandstorm."  
tomb_king.7.c:0 "Great Usirian, turn this storm on our enemies!"  

tomb_king.8.title:0 "Builders of Eternity"  
tomb_king.8.desc:0 "The monuments of Nehekhara stand as eternal reminders of the power and majesty of the Tomb Kings. Their towering pyramids, vast necropolises, and intricate carvings defy the passage of time, proclaiming to the world that Nehekhara's legacy shall endure forever. These wonders were not just built for mortals to admire, but for the gods themselves to envy.\n\nAs you stand before one of these mighty structures, a rare moment of reflection overtakes you. The pride of Nehekhara courses through your veins, and you realize that the achievements of your civilization are unmatched by any other. How should this legacy be immortalized? Through your monuments, your civilization, or your unbroken bloodline?"  
tomb_king.8.a:0 "Our monuments are everlasting."  
tomb_king.8.b:0 "Our civilization is eternal."  
tomb_king.8.c:0 "Our line is unbroken."  

tomb_king.9.title:0 "The Nagashi Cult"  
tomb_king.9.desc:0 "Rumors have surfaced of a hidden cult operating within your lands, worshipping none other than Nagash, the Great Necromancer. These heretics speak of a dark ascension and whisper promises of forbidden power to those who join them. While their presence is a threat to the stability of Nehekhara, they also bring with them rare knowledge and, in some cases, bribes of gold. \n\nThe Mortuary Cult advises rooting out these heretics immediately to prevent their influence from spreading. Others in your court, however, argue that such knowledge could be exploited to strengthen your kingdom, provided you are willing to risk the ire of the gods. The decision lies in your hands—shall you purge the cult, cautiously tolerate their ideas, or accept their gifts in exchange for leniency?"  
tomb_king.9.a:0 "Root it out!"  
tomb_king.9.b:0 "Well, they do have some interesting ideas."  
tomb_king.9.c:0 "... And they bring gifts of gold."  

tomb_king.10.title:0 "Wrath of Usirian"  
tomb_king.10.desc:0 "The skies darken, and the winds howl as a colossal sandstorm descends upon your lands, tearing through settlements and unearthing the ancient tombs of Nehekhara. The priests of Usirian, the ruler of the underworld, declare that this storm is no natural phenomenon but a sign of the god's displeasure with your rule. His judgment is clear—your leadership has strayed from the balance he demands.\n\nThe sandstorm's fury is relentless, devastating fields and scattering the living and the dead alike. The council debates the proper course of action. Some advocate for a grand sacrifice to appease Usirian's anger. Others suggest enduring the storm's destruction, letting it run its course. There is also a bold suggestion: redirect the storm, turning its wrath against your enemies beyond the borders of your realm."  
tomb_king.10.a:0 "Do a sacrifice to please him."  
tomb_king.10.b:0 "Ride out the sandstorm."  
tomb_king.10.c:0 "Great Usirian, turn this storm on our enemies!"
