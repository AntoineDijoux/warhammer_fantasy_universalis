#### Events

skaven.2.t:0 "Challenger Wants the Throne!"
skaven.2.d:0 "Yes-yes! A rival warlord thinks they are better-stronger than you, mighty leader-leader! They have declared their intent to take-take your throne, claiming you are weak-weak and unworthy. Such arrogance! Such foolishness! They gather their followers, calling for your downfall.\n\nWhat will you do, great one? Will you crush them beneath your claw-paw and prove to all who is master? Or maybe-maybe you let them have throne for now... only to take-take it back later, yes-yes? Or will you fight-fight it out in a glorious display of Skaven treachery?"
skaven.2.a:0 "Still Boss-Boss, Yes-Yes!"
skaven.2.b:0 "The Throne is Theirs (For Now!)"
skaven.2.c:0 "Let’s Fight-Fight It Out!"

skaven.3.t:0 "Raiding Party Ready!"
skaven.3.d:0 "Some of our warlord’s most eager-clawed soldiers have grown restless, yes-yes. They sniff-sniff the air and demand-dream of raiding our neighbors! They claim weaklings live on the surface and that they can bring back spoils-riches if we let them.\n\nBut raids cost lives, resources, yes-yes! If we let them go, maybe they win-win and bring glory-power to the clan—or maybe they fail-fail and weaken us all! Will we risk letting these fools leave-leave? Or keep them working here, where they are less likely to die-stupid?"
skaven.3.a:0 "Better Not, Too Risky!"
skaven.3.b:0 "Send Them Out! Yes-Yes!"

skaven.4.t:0 "Sneaky Sneak-Spies Want Work!"
skaven.4.d:0 "A group of suspicious sneaky sneak-rats have come forward, saying they want to work for you, mighty leader-leader! They claim to be the best spies, the best assassins, yes-yes! But who can trust Skaven offering their 'loyalty' so quickly?\n\nIf they speak-truth, they could make us much-stronger. But if they lie-lie, they might turn against us—maybe kill-stab YOU! What do we do, oh great one? Accept their service, watch them close-closely, or drive them out-out for good?"
skaven.4.a:0 "What’s the Worst That Could Happen?"
skaven.4.b:0 "Let Advisors Handle This."
skaven.4.c:0 "No Way, Kick Them Out!"

skaven.5.t:0 "Warpstone Deposit Found!"
skaven.5.d:0 "A glorious-rich warpstone deposit has been found-found, yes-yes! But there is a problem—always a problem! It lies directly beneath one of our thriving rat-warrens. We cannot reach it unless we destroy-collapse the warren and displace all who live there.\n\nWhat do we do, mighty ruler? Should we blast-blast through and take the warpstone immediately? Or should we wait, hoping for an even bigger-better deposit to reveal itself nearby? Or maybe-maybe... leave it alone entirely? But who would do such a thing, yes-yes?"
skaven.5.a:0 "Start Blasting, Warpstone is Life!"
skaven.5.b:0 "Wait, Bigger Deposit Might Be Here!"
skaven.5.c:0 "Leave It Alone... For Now."

skaven.6.t:0 "Scientific Discovery Close-Close!"
skaven.6.d:0 "Great-smart researchers have been experimenting in secret, and they claim-claim they are close-close to a breakthrough! With more warpstone, more resources, or even test-subjects, they could finish their discovery and bring glory-power to your rule!\n\nBut experiments are dangerous-costly, yes-yes! Do we throw money-resources at them to see what they create? Or give them... bodies... to experiment on? Or maybe stop this nonsense entirely—such things are risky, yes-yes!"
skaven.6.a:0 "Throw Money! Science is Power!"
skaven.6.b:0 "Use-Test Subject Rats!"
skaven.6.c:0 "Shut It Down, No Time for This."

skaven.7.t:0 "Warpstone Addiction Spreads!"
skaven.7.d:0 "Warpstone is power-power! But also, twist-bane for the foolish-weak! Some of our rats are eating-snorting too much warpstone, yes-yes. In [province_name], their minds twist-warp, and some are collapsing from the strain. Productivity suffers, but they are stronger and more dangerous in combat.\n\nShould we let them keep consuming warpstone, yes-yes? Or stop them and stabilize the situation? Or perhaps... let them do whatever they want and watch what happens? Choose wisely, great ruler!"
skaven.7.a:0 "Grind It Up and Snort It, Yes-Yes!"
skaven.7.b:0 "Stop Eating the Warpstone, Fools!"
skaven.7.c:0 "Eh, Let Them Do What They Want..."
