 chaotic_changer_of_ways:0 "The Changer of Ways"
 chaotic_changer_of_ways_desc:0 "Tzeentch, the Changer of Ways, weaves the ever-shifting tapestry of fate, reshaping the world with every thought and action.

His followers are often those who seek knowledge beyond mortal comprehension, seeking the answers to mysteries that should not be known, as they bend the rules of reality itself."
 chaotic_garden_of_nurgle:0 "The Lord of Decay"
 chaotic_garden_of_nurgle_desc:0 "Nurgle, the Lord of Decay, is both the giver and the taker of life. His realm is one of pestilence, disease, and inevitable death, but within his sickness lies a strange comfort.

 chaotic_the_dark_prince:0 "The Dark Prince"
 chaotic_the_dark_prince_desc:0 "Slaanesh, the Dark Prince, embodies indulgence, excess, and the pursuit of pleasure in all its forms. His followers are those who seek to embrace the height of sensation—whether in beauty, pain, or desire. In their unending pursuit of pleasure and perfection, they are lost in the extremes of their passions, forever craving more."
 chaotic_chaos_undivided:0 "Chaos, Undivided"
 chaotic_chaos_undivided_desc:0 "Chaos, is the raw, untamed force that encompasses all the Ruinous Powers. It is the singular, unyielding storm that brings destruction to all it touches.

 chaos_innovativness_policy:0 "Twisted Ingenuity"

 chaos_administrative_policy:0 "Order Through Chaos"
 desc_chaos_administrative_policy:0 "Maintaining order among a people whose very way of life is rooted in bloodshed and with a strong warrior's spirit is far more challenging than governing those whose culture is steeped in weakness. Thus, our administrators must undergo even greater training to meet the demands of such a populace."
 chaos_economic_policy:0 "Blood Price"
 desc_chaos_economic_policy:0 "The economy of Chaos is forged in the fires of conflict, where every coin is stained with the price of bloodshed and strife."
