 chaotic_chosen_of_chaos:0 "Chosen of Chaos"
 chaotic_chosen_of_chaos_desc:0 "The Chosen of Chaos are those whose bodies have been marked by the Ruinous Powers themselves.

 chaotic_changer_of_ways:0 "The Changer of Ways"
 chaotic_changer_of_ways_desc:0 "Tzeentch, the Changer of Ways, weaves the ever-shifting tapestry of fate, reshaping the world with every thought and action. He is the harbinger of change, of innovation, and of trickery. His followers are often those who seek knowledge beyond mortal comprehension, seeking the answers to mysteries that should not be known, as they bend the rules of reality itself."
 chaotic_garden_of_nurgle:0 "The Lord of Decay"
 chaotic_garden_of_nurgle_desc:0 "Nurgle, the Lord of Decay, is both the giver and the taker of life. His realm is one of pestilence, disease, and inevitable death, but within his sickness lies a strange comfort.

In the chaos of war, Khorne's champions find their purpose, and in death, their glory."
 chaotic_the_dark_prince:0 "The Dark Prince"
 chaotic_the_dark_prince_desc:0 "Slaanesh, the Dark Prince, embodies indulgence, excess, and the pursuit of pleasure in all its forms. His followers are those who seek to embrace the height of sensation—whether in beauty, pain, or desire. In their unending pursuit of pleasure and perfection, they are lost in the extremes of their passions, forever craving more."
 chaotic_chaos_undivided:0 "Chaos, Undivided"
 chaotic_chaos_undivided_desc:0 "Chaos, is the raw, untamed force that encompasses all the Ruinous Powers. It is the singular, unyielding storm that brings destruction to all it touches.

 chaos_innovativness_policy:0 "Twisted Ingenuity"

 chaos_administrative_policy:0 "Order Through Chaos"
 desc_chaos_administrative_policy:0 "Maintaining order among a people whose very way of life is rooted in bloodshed and with a strong warrior's spirit is far more challenging than governing those whose culture is steeped in weakness. Thus, our administrators must undergo even greater training to meet the demands of such a populace."
 chaos_economic_policy:0 "Blood Price"
 desc_chaos_economic_policy:0 "The economy of Chaos is forged in the fires of conflict, where every coin is stained with the price of bloodshed and strife."

Though they often serve as advisors to Chaos Lords, their cunning and foresight ensure they are the true architects of fate, manipulating events from the shadows. The most favored among them soar into battle atop Daemonic Discs, unleashing devastating sorcery from above."
 tzeentchian_idea_5:0 "The Footsoliders of Change"
 tzeentchian_idea_5_desc:0 "The generals of Tzeentch are renonwned for plotting their militarist engagements to such an elaborate degree that seemingly almost every eventuality in battle has been planed for in advance."
 tzeentchian_idea_6:0 "The Great Conspirator"
 tzeentchian_idea_6_desc:0 "The cultists of tzeentch are the unseen hand that shapes the fate of nations, their schemes woven through every court and council. None can say where their influence begins or ends, for it is as fluid as the tides of fate itself. Every secret whispered, every prophecy spoken, and every betrayal orchestrated—these are but the ripples of a far greater design."
 tzeentchian_idea_7:0 "Merging with Eternity"
 tzeentchian_idea_7_desc:0 "Throughout history, lesser minds have sought to shackle magic with laws and limitations, fearing the boundless potential it offers. Yet in our domain, to speak of such restrictions is not merely folly—it is heresy against the Great Scheme itself. For the pursuit of enlightenment is the highest calling, and the only true law is change."
