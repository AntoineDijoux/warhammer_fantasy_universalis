If we are to restore order, we must strip them of their unchecked power.\n\nHowever, removing the Mages will not be easy. They will resist, retreating into their hidden sanctuaries, plotting their return. The price of reclaiming control will be high, but no nation can endure under the rule of scholars who care more for forbidden knowledge than for the realm they govern."
